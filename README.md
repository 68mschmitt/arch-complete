# Arch Complete

A simple flow charting tool that allows you to create nested nodes and add them to your palette of nodes for future use and reuse

Custom nodes can be organized into user managed directory hierarchies

Custom nodes are made from primitive nodes and previously made custom nodes

Primitive nodes include...
- Input (Single box with connection on right)
- Output (Single box with connection on left)
- Function Node (Single box with connection on left and right)
- Constant Node (Single box with connection on right. Output is user defined)

When a custom node is used in another custom node, the connections the representing box will have available will correspond to the inputs and outputs that the custom node has defined internally
- The location of the connection dots will reflect the layout and orientation of the inputs and outputs defined within the custom node
